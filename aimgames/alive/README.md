# Alive
_A prototype that will never be finished!_
- Do shit

## Chatbox++
_The meanest script in the state of AIM!_

Chatbox++ (formerly Alive Toolset) is a script designed to provide 'universal' (and mostly visual) enhancements for the AIM Games Chatbox.

Chatbox++ is, in no way, meant to replace Swearify and/or Alive -- its premise is to work alongside either/both scripts, but it will still work regardless of which scripts you have installed.

One could also consider Chatbox++ an addon to Swearify/Alive or a family-friendly version of either script.
